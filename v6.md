### Half-open intervals

Change intervals from closed to ahalf-open:

- [x] Make Interval.start / end private
- [x] `setEnd() -> setEndClosed()`: Change code
- [x] `getEnd() -> getEndClosed()`: Change code
- [x] Repalce all direct access by getters / setters (getEndClosed(), setEndClosed())
- [x] New `setEnd()`
- [x] Replace access by getEndClosed  / setEndClosed
- [ ] MarkerSeq.apply: Method should be removed and 'applyIns/Del/etc' should be overriding the parent class
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests

### Interval intersect

Does interval intersect behaviour depend on interval type?

- SpliceSiteAcceptor: An inserion (before) first base: should not have an effect?

- [ ] Exon.intersect(ins_first_base): Insertion at the first base
    - [ ] Insertion at the first base does produce a frame shift
    - [ ] Does this behave different in other markers?
    - [ ] SpliceSite.intersect(ins_first_base): doesn't produce a high impact variant?
    - [ ] Same for exon.apply(ins_first_base)?

# After test OK
- [ ] Try to remove getEndClosed  / setEndClosed, as much as possible
- [ ] Make sure serializations use getEnd (not getEndClosed)[
- [ ] Make sure toString() uses getEnd() instead of getEndClosed() ???

### Splice variants
- [ ] TestCasesIntegrationSpliceRegion: SNV (e.g. compare to ensembl)
- [ ] TestCasesIntegrationSpliceRegion: INS (e.g. compare to ensembl)
- [ ] TestCasesIntegrationSpliceRegion: DEL. Add test case, (compare?)



# AlphaFold
- [ ] Work on test class Zzz.java
- [ ] Find a way to get hydrogen bonds and other (covalent, etc)
